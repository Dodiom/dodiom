Hello üòä

Dodo is trying to learn English, but has a hard time learning English idioms. Could you help him? We ask you to give Dodo plenty of examples, to understand how people use idioms in their daily speech.

Dodo needs lots of  idiom and non-idiom examples.
For example, to learn the idiom \"give up\"\nhe needs an idiom example such as \"Ok, I give up now.\" \nand a non-idiom example such as \"Can you give that book up to me?\"
